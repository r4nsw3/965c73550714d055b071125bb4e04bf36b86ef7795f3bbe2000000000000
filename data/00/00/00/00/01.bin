  |   Playing Chicken Range is simple, shoot as many chickens as you can    |
  |   before you get covered in eggs!                                       |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Fun and Quirky shoot-em-up game.                                      |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The object of the game is to shoot the chickens using an array of     |
  |   different weaponry, from pistols, to AK47, RPG's to Alien Ray Guns!   |
  |   Gameplay is set over a field twice as wide as the screen, so you      |
  |   must be constantly moving your aim side to side in order to reach     |
  |   the whole game field.                                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   To increase the difficulty, the chickens throw eggs at the screen     |
  |   to obscure the player's field of view. Once your screen is            |
  |   covered....GAME OVER!                                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   During each level, ammo crates drop at varying intervals which will   |
  |   refresh your ammo levels and "Shino".                                 |
  |                                                                         |
  |   Carry up to 3 weapons with you; only 4 are available in the earlier   |
  |   levels, the remaining weapons will unlock as you progress through     |
  |   the levels.                                                           |
  |                                                                         |
  |   The game contains 15 different levels. Each level introduces          |
  |   different baddie chickens with varying difficulties to kill them      |
  |   due to enhanced protection gear. Chicken types include Riot Police    |
  |   Chickens, Tank Chickens, Ninja Chickens, Helicopter Chickens and      |
  |   many more!                                                            |
